# Frontend

## Prerequisites

```sh
Angular CLI: 18.2.10
Node: 22.9.0
Package Manager: npm 10.8.3
```

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.10.


## Quickstart

Note: the npm commands are wrappers around `ng serve` etc., which also triggers code generation. When the openapi files change, use `npm run generate-sources` to rerun code generation.

```sh
npm start
```

inside a container

```sh
npm start -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint`
